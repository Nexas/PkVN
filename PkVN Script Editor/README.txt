Okay, the Script Editor is pretty easy to use, I made it so that it takes care of most things behind the scenes, such as prefixes and extensions, but just to clarify any and all rules:

NOTES:
-A Script name MUST be written before creating the script, or else the program will yell at you.
-The Move Up and Move Down buttons will simply move lines around, nothing more.
-There is no undo for any action, so be careful if you're removing lines. (Will possibly be an addition in later versions)
-Decisions DO NOT have to be in every script (Nor should they be). If there are no decisions, use a Script End symbol ($) with the name of the script to go to next.
-You DO NOT need to specify extenstions or prefixes with any line added into the script (So no need to add "PvN_" or ".pscr").
-Even if there are decisions in a script, there still MUST be a Script End symbol ($), but put by itself, with no script file added after (so no text in the textbox).
-Rememebr that the End Prefix (+) is used to seperate what is initialized immediately (what comes before the symbol), and what gets placed into a queue (what comes after).

KNOWN BuGS:
(None that I know of so far, but please add them if you see some, I'd like to make this tool as close to perfect as possible!)
